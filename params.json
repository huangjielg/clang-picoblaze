{"body":"//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//\r\n// C Language Family Front-end\r\n//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//\r\n\r\nWelcome to Clang.  This is a compiler front-end for the C family of languages\r\n(C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which is built as part of the LLVM\r\ncompiler infrastructure project.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other compiler frontends, Clang is useful for a number of things\r\nbeyond just compiling code: we intend for Clang to be host to a number of\r\ndifferent source level tools.  One example of this is the Clang Static Analyzer.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in more (including how to build Clang) it is best to read\r\nthe relevant web sites.  Here are some pointers:\r\n\r\nInformation on Clang:              http://clang.llvm.org/\r\nBuilding and using Clang:          http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html\r\nClang Static Analyzer:             http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/\r\nInformation on the LLVM project:   http://llvm.org/\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or comments about Clang, a great place to discuss them is\r\non the Clang development mailing list:\r\n  http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug in Clang, please file it in the LLVM bug tracker:\r\n  http://llvm.org/bugs/\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
